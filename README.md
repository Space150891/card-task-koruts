# Assignment

In this assignment you will Implement a simple Card component.

Launch the test-job assignment using

```bash
yarn
yarn cosmos
```

Instructions:

1. At the end of the assignment submit only the following file: `src/components/Card/index.tsx`, i.e., write all of the code inside this file.
2. You may add any packages.
3. Make sure each React-Cosmos fixture meets its picture. For example the fixture `kdk20aps` should look like: `src/components/Card/__fixtures__/kdk20aps.png`.
4. You may use the design file `card.sketch`
5. Good Luck!
